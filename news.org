Out of curiosity, since September the 30th, the Computational Logic
website managed traffic for **270 GB** (and we are a small website;
imagine the traffic generated by Netflix and other streaming
services). 

These are the most downloaded materials and the relative bandwidth on
the server:

  - The video of L8.T72.FOL.Language has been fixed.  The previous
    version had an issue in the first few minutes due to a
    post-processing error.
  - Fixed a glitch in the calendar, according to which some lessons
    did not appear in their natural order.

* New Material published (Posted on: [2020-09-28 Mon])

  The material for L5, L6, and L7 has been published on the website.

* Tic-Tac-Toe (Posted on: [2020-09-23 Wed])

  A revised version of the slides presented on Tuesday is now
  available on the website. 

  The revised slides are marked "New" and "Revised", to simplify a
  second lecture to the students who attended the live session.
