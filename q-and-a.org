Instructions:

- Post your question and doubts by opening an issue on the [[https://github.com/avillafiorita/cl-2020][cl-2020
  repository]] on Github, where this website is hosted, **on the
  Thursday before** the lesson in which you want to discuss your
  question.  To avoid useless work on both sides, make sure you
  **check the open issues before posting a new question**.  Note that
  you might need to register on GitHub, if you don't have an account.
